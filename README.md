# Movie App

## Description
This react app allows the user to search a Movie name, and retrieve some basic details about it from the tmdb api. The user can view trending movies from the homepage, and by clicking the tabs in the navbar, they can also vew popular and top rated movies from the tmdb api. Once signed up and logged in, the user can add movies to their favorites list, and rate or remove them as they please.

## Set up instructions
The user must clone the repo, and make a config.js file in the backend directory that exports their tmdb api key. For example:

![example config.js file](https://github.com/cop4808-spring-2023-fullstack-web/final-project-Group-6/blob/main/frontend2/movie-app/public/config_example.jpg?raw=true)

Then, the user must include a json file named "./hw11-c04ee-firebase-adminsdk-24c14-f3334f505b.json" in the backend directory:
![example ./hw11-c04ee-firebase-adminsdk-24c14-f3334f505b.json file](https://github.com/cop4808-spring-2023-fullstack-web/final-project-Group-6/blob/main/frontend2/movie-app/public/firebase_example.jpg?raw=true)

To run the application, first make sure you have done the necessary npm installs in the frontend and the backend, the json files show the dependencies. Then navigate to frontend2/movie-app and enter ```npm start``` in the terminal.
Then, in a separate terminal, navigate to the backend directory and enter ```node server.js``` to
run the server.
